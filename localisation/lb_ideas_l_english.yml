This idea serves as a disincentive for you to take advantage of historical foresight and pre-build refineries in advance of Japan's attack. Instead, you are incentivized to hold on to what limited natural rubber supplies you can for as long as possible, while scrambling to begin synthetic rubber production. You should expect some short-term rubber shortages.\n\nYou can get rid of this penalty and instead get a bonus to refinery construction by completing your synthetic rubber focus, which is available as soon as Japan joins the war."
