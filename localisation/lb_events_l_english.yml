 lbevents.13.d:0 "Danger faces us. We must act quickly and decisively, or it will be too late.Total war is the demand of the hour. The danger facing us is enormous. The efforts we take to meet it must be just as enormous. We can no longer make only partial and careless use of the war potential at home and in the significant parts of Europe that we control. The National Socialist government is ready to use every means; we do not care if anyone objects! I ask you: Do you believe with the Führer and us in the final total victory of the German people? Are you resolved to follow the Führer through thick and thin to victory, and are you willing to accept the heaviest personal burdens? I ask you: Do you want total war? If necessary, do you want a war more total and radical than anything that we can even imagine today? The Führer has commanded, and we will follow him. In this hour of national reflection and contemplation, we believe firmly and unshakably in victory. We see it before us, we need only reach for it. We must resolve to subordinate everything to it. That is the duty of the hour."
